Here are data-driven insights that car dealerships can use to make strategic decisions on inventory acquisition, pricing strategies, and targeted marketing to optimize their profitability in the competitive used car market:

The analysis suggests that states like Hawaii, Utah, Alaska, Washington, and Louisiana consistently offer the highest resale values for used cars, contrasting with Rhode Island, Connecticut, Ohio, Virginia, and North Dakota, which exhibit the lowest. Dealerships can capitalize on this by strategically purchasing vehicles in lower-value markets and selling them in higher-value ones to maximize profit margins.

Vehicles with salvage titles, on average, see a reduction in value by approximately $3,794. This insight opens an opportunity for dealerships to acquire salvage vehicles at prices significantly below this amount, refurbish them if feasible, and sell them to achieve substantial profit margins, provided the costs of repair and refurbishment justify the investment.

Diesel vehicles have a premium of about  13,000𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑖𝑟𝑔𝑎𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑠.𝑇ℎ𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑑𝑖𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑢𝑔𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑠𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑡𝑎𝑐𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑑𝑖𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑠𝑎𝑡𝑎𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑛
 13,000 compared to equivalent gasoline models presents a lucrative opportunity for dealerships to enhance profits, particularly if market demand supports higher pricing for diesel options.

Despite manual transmissions being generally less costly to manufacture than automatic ones, the model indicates a consumer willingness to pay a premium for used cars equipped with manual transmissions. Although the overall demand for manual transmission vehicles might be lower, targeting the niche market of enthusiasts and buyers with a preference for manuals could lead to higher profit margins on these sales.
